# Implementation and Validation of an AEB System Using CARLA Simulator


Simulation and validation of an Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) system using CARLA and ROS according to Euro NCAP protocols.

## Overview
This project implements an AEB system in a simulated environment using CARLA and ROS. The system reproduces Euro NCAP scenarios such as braking lead vehicle, cut-in, and pedestrian crossing to evaluate safety and performance.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/carla_ros_aeb_euro_ncap.git
cd carla_ros_aeb_euro_ncap
